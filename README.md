# Yonder

Yonder is a menubar app intended to turn checking the weather from an algorithm into a boolean.

The menubar icon displays a ☀︎ if you should go outside and a ⧄ if you shouldn't. 

The boolean is determined by several factors including:
- `Feels like`, a calculation based on:
  - Temperature
  - Relative humidity
  - Wind speed
- The probably of rain in the next 1-2 hours.
